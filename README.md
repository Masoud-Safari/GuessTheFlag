# GuessTheFlag: A Flag Recognition Game

## Introduction

As part of my exploration into iOS development through the Hacking with Swift course, I developed GuessTheFlag. This project focuses on reinforcing core SwiftUI concepts by creating an engaging game that challenges users to identify different countries' flags.

## Project Description

### What the App Does

- **Functionality:** GuessTheFlag presents users with a selection of flags and prompts them to choose the correct one based on the country name shown. Points are awarded for correct guesses, and the game tracks the user's score throughout the session.
- **Technologies Used:** Developed entirely in SwiftUI, this app utilizes state management, animations, and user interaction handling to create a dynamic and responsive gaming experience.
- **App Demo:**

### Purpose and Learning

- **Objective:** The main objective was to deepen my understanding of SwiftUI by building an application that required user interaction, state management, and animations. This project allowed me to practice designing a user-friendly interface while handling game logic efficiently.
- **Challenges and Solutions:** Implementing animations that felt smooth and natural was a challenge. I experimented with various SwiftUI animation modifiers and eventually utilized implicit and explicit animation in combination with state changes to achieve the desired effects.
- **Skills Gained:** This project helped solidify my grasp of SwiftUI, particularly in designing UIs, managing state, and incorporating animations. It also improved my problem-solving skills and my ability to implement intuitive user interfaces.
